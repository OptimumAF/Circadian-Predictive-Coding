# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied on a best-effort basis to the default branch.

## Reporting A Vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Report privately to:

- `@OptimumAF`

Include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Reproduction steps and expected impact
- Any proof-of-concept details (minimal and safe)
- Suggested remediation if available

You should receive an acknowledgment within 5 business days. We aim to provide a remediation plan
or status update within 14 business days.

## Disclosure

We prefer coordinated disclosure. Once fixed, maintainers will publish a security note in
`CHANGELOG.md` and credit reporters when requested.
